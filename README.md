# Natours-description

This is practice project i've developed by following along with Jonas Schmedtmann's Advanced CSS and Sass course.

<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
  <li>HTML5</li>
  <li>SCSS(BEM)</li>
  <li>NPM&NPM Scripts</li>
</ul>

<h2>What i've learned?</h2>

During creation of this landing page i learnd about many new Css properties and techniques,in which i didn't had
prevoius experience,and best ways how to implement them in project.

While creating the header part of the page i've learned how to use "clip-path"property,which gives really nice
design feature where backgrounds are cut off.
